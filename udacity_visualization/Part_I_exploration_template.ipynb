    "> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. We can download 12 monthly data from January 2019 to December 2019 to make a full year coverage. The data files can be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and then be joined together into a single file. Then we'll assess and clean the dataset and store the clean data for our analysis. To get started, let's import our libraries.\n",
